# 🧙‍♂️ GandALF
This repository contains the source code of the Gaussian n-dimensional Active Learning Framework (GandALF).
The original version of GandALF is described [in this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125340).

## 🔨 Installation
GandALF is built upon NumPy, Pandas, and GPyOpt. Because of the strong dependency on GPy and GPyOpt, 
it is recommended to use python version 3.7. A stable release for newer python versions 
will be made available in a future update. <br>
The package can be installed using pip:

Install a virtual environment in Anaconda:
```
conda create -n gandalf-doe python=3.7
conda activate gandalf-doe
```

```
git clone https://github.com/mrodobbe/gandalf-doe.git
cd gandalf-doe
pip install .
```
## 👩🏽‍🔬 How to use the code?
An instruction on how to use GandALF is given in `notebooks/demo.ipynb`.
